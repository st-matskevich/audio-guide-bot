# Audio Guide Bot
Telegram bot for taking audio tours. Built on top of [Telegram Mini App Template](https://github.com/st-matskevich/tg-mini-app-template). Available at [@audio_guide_bot](https://t.me/audio_guide_bot).

## Setup prerequisites
[Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) token is required to interact with [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). To get one, —Åreate a bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) or follow [Telegram instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).

[Telegram Payments](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) token is required to start accepting payments for tickets. To get one, request it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) or follow [Telegram instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#connecting-payments).

## Local environment
This repository provides an easy-to-use local development environment. Using it you can start writing your bot business logic without spending time on the environment.

Local environment includes:
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) reverse proxy to server local mini-app and bot deployment over HTTPS
- [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) reverse proxy to host both API and UI on one ngrok domain and thus fit into the [free plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing)
- React fast refresh to avoid rebuilding docker container on each change of the UI code
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database instance and [pgAdmin](https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4) instance to manage it
- [s3gw](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw) S3 instance and [s3gw-ui](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw-ui) instance to manage it

Local environment setup:
1. Create an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
0. Get a [ngrok auth token](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/) and save it to `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Claim a [free ngrok domain](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users) and save it to `NGROK_DOMAIN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Copy [Telegram Bot token](#setup-prerequisites) and save it to `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Copy [Telegram Payments token](#setup-prerequisites) and save it to `TELEGRAM_PAYMENTS_TOKEN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Generate random string for JWT signing secret and save it to `JWT_SECRET` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

To start or update the environment with the latest code changes, use:
```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

After successful deployment, your local bot API will be available at https://ngrok-domain/api. Use this URL to set the bot webhook as described [switching bot environment](#switching-bot-environment).

## Production deployment
This repository provides a [workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions) to automatically deploy the code to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). The deploy job is triggered on each push to the [main](https://github.com/st-matskevich/audio-guide-bot/tree/main) branch.

After successful deployment, obtain the bot API URL from either `deploy-api` job results or from [GCP Project Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and proceed to [switching bot environment](#switching-bot-environment).

## Switching bot environment
After the bot is either [launched locally](#local-environment) or [deployed in GCP](#production-deployment), Telegram needs to be configured with a proper webhook URL. To set it, use:
```sh
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/setWebhook?url=${BOT_API_URL}/bot
```
