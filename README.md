# Audio Guide Bot
Telegram bot for taking audio tours, built on top of [Telegram Mini App Template](https://github.com/st-matskevich/tg-mini-app-template). 

Guide is available at [@audio_guide_bot](https://t.me/audio_guide_bot).  
Bot supports mobile Telegram clients with Telegram Bot API version of at least 6.9.   
Payments are working in test mode. Transactions must be made using using test cards like `4242 4242 4242 4242`, other cards can be found in [payments provider docs](https://guide.tranzzo.com/docs/testing/cards/).  
QR codes for the bot can be found in [/admin/test-data](/admin/test-data).

## Features
- Integration with [Telegram Payments](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) - Guide Bot tickets can be bought directly in Telegram
- Integration with [Telegram CloudStorage](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#cloudstorage) - after activation, the user's ticket is available to all user devices
- UI delivered as [Telegram Mini App](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) - no need for a standalone application, Guide Bot is available as a part of Telegram bot
- Adaptive UI - Guide Bot will automatically pick up the user's color theme and adapt the size to both expanded and minimized modes
- [Local environment](#local-environment) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)- spin-up bot environment locally in one command
- [Continious deliviery](#production-deployment) to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) - all changes to the `main` branch are automatically delivered to the production

0. Message your bot, buy a ticket, scan the code, and start listening

## Setup prerequisites
[Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) token is required to interact with [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). To get one, —Åreate a bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) or follow [Telegram bot instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).

[Telegram Payments](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) token is required to start accepting payments for tickets. To get one, request it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) or follow [Telegram payments instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#connecting-payments).

## Local environment
This repository provides an easy-to-use local development environment. Using it you can start writing your bot business logic without spending time on the environment.

Local environment includes:
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) reverse proxy to server local mini-app and bot deployment over HTTPS
- [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) reverse proxy to host both API and UI on one ngrok domain and thus fit into the [free plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing)
- React fast refresh to avoid rebuilding docker container on each change of the UI code
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database instance and [pgAdmin](https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4) instance to manage it
- [s3gw](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw) S3 instance and [s3gw-ui](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw-ui) instance to manage it

Local environment setup:
1. Create an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
0. Get a [ngrok auth token](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/) and save it to `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Claim a [free ngrok domain](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users) and save it to `NGROK_DOMAIN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Copy [Telegram Bot token](#setup-prerequisites) and save it to `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Copy [Telegram Payments token](#setup-prerequisites) and save it to `TELEGRAM_PAYMENTS_TOKEN` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Generate random string for JWT signing secret and save it to `JWT_SECRET` variable in `.env` file in the project root directory
0. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

To start or update the environment with the latest code changes, use:
```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

After successful deployment, your local bot API will be available at https://ngrok-domain/api. Use this URL to set the bot webhook as described [switching bot environment](#switching-bot-environment).

## Production deployment
This repository provides a [workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions) to automatically deploy the code to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). The deploy job is triggered on each push to the [main](https://github.com/st-matskevich/audio-guide-bot/tree/main) branch.

After successful deployment, obtain the bot API URL from either `deploy-services` job results or from [GCP Project Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and proceed to [switching bot environment](#switching-bot-environment).

## Switching bot environment
After the bot is either [launched locally](#local-environment) or [deployed in GCP](#production-deployment), Telegram needs to be configured with a proper webhook URL. To set it, use:
```sh
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/setWebhook?url=${BOT_API_URL}/bot
```

## Administration
In the case of [local environment](#local-environment), [pgAdmin](https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4) for DB management and [s3gw-ui](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw-ui) for S3 management are already running as containers. Discover their addresses in your [docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/).  
In case of [production deployment](#production-deployment), S3 management is available from [GCP Project Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), but for DB management you need to setup an instance of [pgAdmin](https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4) with [cloud-sql-proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy) to connect to your Cloud SQL instance. Instructions are available in [/admin](/admin).

To create an object in the Guide Bot you need:
1. Prepare the data
    - **Title**: string that will be displayed as a title of the object. It must not exceed 64 characters
    - **Code**: string that will be encoded in a QR code to access your object
    - **Covers**: collection of image files that will be displayed while listening to the Guide. Amount of covers is not limited. Cover image can be any size but will be cropped to 1:1 proportions to fit in the UI. Also, keep in mind that a large size slows down the loading of the object.
    - **Audio**: audio file that will be played when viewing the object. It can be any size, but keep in mind that a large size slows down the loading of the object.
0. Upload **Covers** and **Audio** to S3 bucket using S3 management tool and save paths to the uploaded files. Make sure to include the original file extension in the file name otherwise, some clients will not be able to play audio tracks.
0. Connect to the DB and create a new row in the `objects` table using DB management tool
    - Set `code` to the value of  **Code**
    - Set `title` to the value of  **Title**
    - Set `audio` to the path of the uploaded file **Audio**
0. Create a new row in the `covers` table for each uploaded file from **Covers** collection
    - Set `object_id` to the id of the row created in the previous step
    - Set `index` to the number indicating the order in which the picture will be displayed
    - Set `path` to the path of the uploaded file from **Covers** collection
0. Encode **Code** to the QR Code to access your object from the Guide Bot 

For testing purposes you also can use files from [/admin/test-data](/admin/test-data).

## Project overview
Project is built of 4 parts:
- API Service - implements integration with Telegram API and Guide business logic
- UI Service - user interface in the format of Telegram MiniApp 
- Database - stores entity data such as tickets or objects
- Blob storage - stores binary files such as object images or audio tracks

Project design:
- Base project entity is called Object - any point of interest that will be available in the system
- All objects include:
  - Title - name of the object
  - Code - unique text data that is used for object identification
  - Covers - array of images associated with the object
  - Audio - audio track associated with the object
- Access to the objects is provided by scanning QR codes with encoded object code
- Access to the objects is limited by token-based authorization
- Token validity is limited by the expiration date
- Token must be persisted until it becomes invalid
- Token can be acquired by activating a separate entity - Ticket
- Ticket includes:
  - Code - unique text data that is used for ticket identification
  - Activation flag - once set to true, cannot be activated anymore
- Ticket can be bought via Telegram Payments
